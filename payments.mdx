## Why ZBD Payments?

### The Problem with Traditional Payments

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Microtransaction Hell">
    **Card Networks:**
    - Minimum ~$0.30 fee per transaction
    - Can't send 0.10c when fees are 0.30c
    - Chargebacks eat profits
    - High decline rates
    
    **ZBD Payments:**
    - Send amounts as low as $0.001
    - Proportional fees (typically < 1%)
    - No chargebacks
    - Near 100% success rate
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Developer Friction">
    **Legacy Providers:**
    - Complex integration (weeks/months)
    - Different APIs per country
    - Compliance nightmares
    - Poor documentation
    
    **ZBD Payments:**
    - Single API globally
    - 5-minute quick start
    - Compliance built-in
    - Stripe-quality docs
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cross-Border Nightmare">
    **Traditional Systems:**
    - 3-5 day settlement times
    - $25-45 fees per transaction
    - Limited to banking hours
    - Blocked in many countries
    
    **ZBD Payments:**
    - Instant settlement (< 1 second)
    - Fees from $0.0001
    - 24/7/365 availability
    - Works in globally
  </Tab>
