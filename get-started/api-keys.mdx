API keys are your passport to the ZBD platform. With a single key, you can send payments globally, create invoices, manage wallets, and build the future of digital payments.

<Warning>
  **Security First** - API keys are server-side only and grant full access to your project's wallet. Never expose them in client-side code, mobile apps, or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Your First API Key

Navigate to your project's **API** tab to view and manage your API keys.

## Quick Start Example

Once you have your API key, you're ready to send your first payment:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.zebedee.io/v0/payments \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "1000",
    "description": "First payment!",
    "internalId": "test-001",
    "callbackUrl": "https://myapp.com/webhook"
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const payment = await fetch('https://api.zebedee.io/v0/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'apikey': process.env.ZBD_API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: '1000',
    description: 'First payment!',
    internalId: 'test-001'
  })
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

### üîê Secure Storage

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variables">
    ```bash
    # .env file (never commit this!)
    ZBD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    
    # Access in code
    const apiKey = process.env.ZBD_API_KEY;
    ```
    
    **Best for**: Local development and deployment platforms
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Secret Management">
    Use dedicated secret management services:
    
    - **AWS Secrets Manager**
    - **Google Secret Manager**
    - **HashiCorp Vault**
    - **Azure Key Vault**
    
    **Best for**: Production environments
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CI/CD">
    Configure secrets in your deployment pipeline:
    
    - **GitHub Actions**: Repository secrets
    - **Vercel**: Environment variables
    - **Heroku**: Config vars
    - **Docker**: Build secrets
    
    **Best for**: Automated deployments
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### üõ°Ô∏è IP Allowlisting

Restrict API access to specific IP addresses for maximum security:

<Frame caption="ZBD Developer Dashboard | Allowed IPs">
  <img src="/img/v3/api-key-3.png" alt="ZBD Developer Dashboard | Allowed IPs" />
</Frame>

**How to Configure:**
1. Navigate to your project's API tab
2. Click "API Access Controls"
3. Add your server's IP addresses
4. Save changes

<Info>
  **Dynamic IPs?** If your infrastructure uses dynamic IPs (like serverless functions), consider using a proxy service with static IPs or contact our team for alternative security options.
</Info>

## Key Rotation & Regeneration

Regular key rotation is a security best practice. Here's when and how to do it:

### When to Rotate Keys

- ‚è∞ **Scheduled**: Every 90 days as a best practice
- üö® **Immediately if**:
  - Key exposed in client code
  - Committed to version control
  - Employee with access leaves
  - Suspicious activity detected

### How to Regenerate

<Frame caption="ZBD Developer Dashboard | Regenerate API Key">
  <img src="/img/v3/api-key-2.png" alt="ZBD Developer Dashboard | Regenerate API Key" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Regenerating creates a new key and immediately disables the old one. Update your applications before regenerating to avoid downtime.
</Warning>

### Zero-Downtime Rotation Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan the Rotation">
    Schedule during low-traffic period
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Staging First">
    Test new key in staging environment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to Production">
    Update production with new key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regenerate Key">
    Once deployed, regenerate in dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor">
    Watch logs for any failed authentications
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Key Permissions (Coming Soon)

<Info>
  **Scoped Permissions** - Soon you'll be able to create keys with limited permissions:
  - Read-only keys for analytics
  - Payment-only keys for point-of-sale
  - Receive-only keys for donation pages
</Info>

## Testing Your API Key

Use this simple test to verify your key is working:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.zebedee.io/v0/wallet \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript Node.js
// Quick test script
const testApiKey = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.zebedee.io/v0/wallet', {
    headers: { 'apikey': process.env.ZBD_API_KEY }
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    console.log('‚úÖ API key is valid!');
    const wallet = await response.json();
    console.log('Balance:', wallet.data.balance, 'sats');
  } else {
    console.error('‚ùå API key test failed:', response.status);
  }
};

testApiKey();
```
</CodeGroup>
