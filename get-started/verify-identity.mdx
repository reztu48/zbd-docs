Identity verification unlocks the full power of ZBD. As a regulated financial institution, we're required to verify all businesses before enabling production access â€“ but we've made it as painless as possible.

<Info>
  **Why Verification Matters** - ZBD is a licensed money transmitter in the US (MSB/MTL) and an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) in the EU under MiCAR. This means your funds are protected and your business is compliant.
