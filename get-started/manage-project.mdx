  - No new transactions possible
  - Wallet funds auto-transfer to main wallet
  - Action cannot be undone

<Note>
  **Pro Tip**: Set up a project naming convention early. As you scale, having organized projects with clear names like "AppName-Prod-US" and "AppName-Dev-EU" will save hours of confusion.
