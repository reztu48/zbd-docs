Projects are your gateway to the future of payments. Each project gets its own Lightning wallet, API keys, and analytics â€“ everything you need to integrate ZBD into your app or game.

<Info>
  **One Account, Multiple Projects** - Create separate projects for different apps, environments, or business units. Each project has isolated wallets and permissions.

## Project Best Practices

### Environment Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Development Setup">
    Create separate projects for each environment:
    
    - **MyGame - Development**: Sandbox testing with test transactions
    - **MyGame - Staging**: Pre-production testing with real money
    - **MyGame - Production**: Live environment for real users
    
    This separation ensures clean analytics and prevents accidental transactions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multi-App Setup">
    Organize projects by application:
    
    - **Mobile Game**: iOS and Android API keys sharing one wallet
    - **Web Platform**: Separate wallet with frontend/backend keys
    - **Tournament System**: Isolated wallet for prize pools
    
    Each app gets its own analytics and wallet management.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
