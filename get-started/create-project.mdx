Projects are the gateway into using the [ZBD API](/payments/api). Each project comes with a unique API key and a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. With this API key, you can receive funds, make payments, and withdraw Bitcoin â€” the API makes it possible to handle everything programmatically.

## 1 - Navigate to Projects 

Navigate to the `Projects` page in the sidebar menu and click the `+ New Project` button in the top right of the page to open up the Create Project modal.

  <img src="/img/v3/create-project.png" alt="ZBD Developer Dashboard | Projects" />
</Frame>
<br />

## 2 - Enter Project details

Complete the fields in the modal. The Project Name and Project Description fields are required, while the Project Image is highly recommended.

</Frame>
<br />

<Tip>Your _Project Name_ and _Project Image_ will appear in the ZBD Rewards App if you make a payment using the ZBD Gamertag system of APIs. The image needs to be square and less than 3 MB to upload and display properly.</Tip>  

## 3 - Submit

Now, click `Create Project` -- you will be redirected to the Project's Wallet tab once its successfully created.

## Next Steps

**Success! You've just created your first ZBD Project.**
