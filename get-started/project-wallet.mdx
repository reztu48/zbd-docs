Every ZBD project comes with its own programmable Bitcoin Lightning wallet. This isolated wallet gives you complete control over your project's funds, transactions, and financial operations â€“ all accessible via API.

<Info>
  **Core Architecture**: 1 Project = 1 Wallet = 1 API Key. This separation ensures clean accounting, isolated risk, and granular control.

```
</CodeGroup>

### Transfer Between Projects
<CodeGroup>

// Transfer funds between your projects
const result = await zbd.internalTransfer({
  amount: 10000,
  receiverWalletId: 'project_abc123',
  reference: 'Budget reallocation'
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.zebedee.io/v0/internal-transfer \

<Note>
  **Pro Tip**: Use project wallets to isolate financial risk. If one project has issues, your other projects remain unaffected. This is especially important for testing new features or running experiments.
