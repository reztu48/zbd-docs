ZBD Gamertags are unique identifiers that make sending rewards as easy as tagging a friend. Every ZBD user has a gamertag â€“ their identity across the entire rewards ecosystem.

<Info>
  **Like Social Handles** - Gamertags work like Twitter handles or Discord usernames. Easy to remember, easy to share, perfect for rewards.

## Common Gamertag Patterns

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technical Considerations

### Gamertag vs User ID

<Warning>
  **Important**: Gamertags can change! For permanent user tracking, use the immutable User ID.
</Warning>

```javascript
// Get permanent User ID from gamertag
const response = await fetch(`/v0/user-id/gamertag/${gamertag}`, {
  headers: { 'apikey': API_KEY }
});

const { id } = await response.json().data;
// id: "0a59bf56-daa3-4888-8330-cbc02eba3a6e" (never changes)

// Use for:
// - User limits/thresholds
// - Historical tracking
// - Database references
```

### Handling Edge Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Changed Gamertag">
    Use User ID for persistent tracking. Gamertags are like social handles - they can change.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Gamertag">
    API returns clear error. Show user-friendly message: "User not found. Check the gamertag?"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Special Characters">
    Only letters, numbers allowed. Validate before sending.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
