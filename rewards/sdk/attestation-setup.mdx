In order to ensure we have everything we need to detect whether your app has not been tampered with as part of our attestation check, we require a couple of pieces of information.

Here is a handy video guide:

## Android

For Android, we need your **Bundle ID** or **package name**, i.e.`com.domain.appname`, which you set in your Unity build settings.

<Warning>
    This is NOT the appId ZBD provides you.
</Warning>

We also need the **SHA-256 hash** of your signing key.

To find your app's SHA-256 hash key for Google Play:
<Steps>
    <Step title="Access Google Play Console">
        Sign in to your Google Play Console account.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select your app">
        Choose the app for which you need the SHA-256 hash.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to Release">
        Go to the Release section in the left-hand menu.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to Setup">
        Click on Setup in the submenu.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select App integrity from the options">

    </Step>
    <Step title=" Click on App signing">

    </Step>
    <Step title="Find the App signing key certificate">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select and copy the SHA-256 Fingerprint">
    </Step>
</Steps>

During development, you are likely using a custom keystore in Unity, so we will need that **SHA-256 hash** as well. You can generate the SHA-256 hash key for your keystore using the following command:
```bash
 keytool -list -v -keystore path/to/your.keystore -alias your_alias -storepass your_keystore_password -keypass your_key_password
```
<Note>
    It should look something like this :
    EA:A1:69:AA:2F:FC:6D:16:84:ED:06:11:E0:65:2B:E0:BB:9C:5B:E3:41:96:06:E2:3D:85:8F:2C:22:2A:E9:86
</Note>

## iOS
For iOS we need your **Bundle ID** i.e.`app id`, e.g.`com.domain.appname` and your **Team ID**.
To find your app's Team ID for Apple Developer:
<Steps>
    <Step title="Access Appel Developer Account">
        Sign in to your Apple Developer account
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click on Membershipt details">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select and copy Team ID">
    </Step>
</Steps>
