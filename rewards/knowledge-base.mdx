## Why This Knowledge Matters

### The Cost of Getting It Wrong

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Security Breaches">
    **Without Proper Security:**
    - Hackers drain reward pools
    - Fake rewards flood the system
    - Player trust destroyed
    - Potential legal issues
    
    **One game lost $50,000 in 24 hours** due to a simple client-trust vulnerability.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Poor Implementation">
    **Common Mistakes Cost:**
    - Players exploit imbalanced rewards
    - Server costs spiral out of control
    - Retention actually decreases
    - Negative reviews pile up
    
    **Proper implementation drives 3-5x ROI** on reward spend.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scaling Issues">
    **Growing Pains:**
    - Rewards system can't handle success
    - Database locks under load
    - API rate limits hit
    - Players face delays
    
    **Plan for 100x growth** from day one.
