## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

- [ZBD Project with a Live API key](/get-started/api-keys)

## 1. Create a Node.js project

Start with a brand new empty directory called `node-example` and run the following command to initiate a Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

## 2. Install @zbdpay/payments-sdk Node.js SDK

Install ZBD:

<CodeGroup>

```bash yarn
yarn add @zbdpay/payments-sdk
```

```bash npm
npm install @zbdpay/payments-sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @zbdpay/payments-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Send and receive Bitcoin

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code:

```js
import ZbdPayments from '@zbdpay/payments-sdk';

const ZBD_API_KEY = 'b7YW3s2JzZKGcXjIf5Dqof8wjKT2RuWr8'; // dummy key
const client = new ZbdPayments({
  apikey: ZBD_API_KEY,
});

(async function () {
  try {
    const data = await client.lightningCharges.create({
      amount: '100000',
      callbackUrl: 'https://your-app.com/zbd-callback',
      description: 'Node.js + ZBD!',
    });

    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
})();
```

Run the following command to start your Node.js server:

<CodeGroup>

```bash yarn
yarn start
```

```bash npm
npm start
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Tip>You may need to add a `start` script to your `package.json` file such as `node index.js`.</Tip>

You're looking for the `data.invoice.request` property in the JSON response. It starts with `lnbc1` and is the payment request anyone in the Bitcoin Lightning Network can use to pay you.

```

<Info>Charges and payment requests are usually shown to users as QR codes that can be scanned by mobile apps (e.g. [ZBD](https://zbd.one/download)). Read [Callbacks](/payments/api/callbacks) to understand how to receive updates about your payment asynchronously.</Info>

## 3. Try it yourself

You can now send and receive instant Bitcoin payments using Express.js + ZBD!
