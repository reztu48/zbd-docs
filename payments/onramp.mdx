const session = await zbd.onramp.createSession({
  userId: "player_123",
  email: "player@game.com"
});

// 2. Embed widget (frontend)
<iframe src={session.widgetUrl} />

// 3. Handle webhooks
app.post('/webhooks/zbd', (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.event === 'purchase.completed') {
    // Credit user's game wallet
