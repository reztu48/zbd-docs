## Integration at a Glance

```typescript
// 1. Initialize session (backend)
import { initRampSession, QuoteCurrencyEnum, BaseCurrencyEnum } from '@zbdpay/ramp-ts';

const response = await initRampSession({
  apikey: process.env.ZBD_API_KEY,
  email: "player@game.com",
  webhook_url: "https://yourgame.com/webhooks/zbd",
  quote_currency: QuoteCurrencyEnum.USD,
  base_currency: BaseCurrencyEnum.BTC,
  destination: "spiderman@zbd.gg",
  reference_id: "player_123"
});

const sessionToken = response.data.session_token;

// 2. Embed widget (frontend)
import { ZBDRamp } from '@zbdpay/ramp-react';

<ZBDRamp 
  sessionToken={sessionToken}
  onSuccess={(data) => console.log('Purchase completed:', data)}
/>

// 3. Handle webhooks
app.post('/webhooks/zbd', (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.event === 'purchase.completed') {
    // Credit user's game wallet
  }
});
```

That's it. One backend endpoint, one iframe, one webhook handler.
