Lightning Address is the protocol that made Bitcoin payments as simple as sending an email. Created by Andre Neves (CTO of ZBD) in 2021, it has become the standard for user-friendly Bitcoin payments, processing millions of transactions across hundreds of apps and services globally.

<Info>
  **Fun Fact**: Lightning Address was invented at ZBD to solve a real problem ‚Äì our users were terrified of long Bitcoin Lightning invoices. Today, it's an open protocol used by the entire Lightning ecosystem.

## The UX Revolution

### Before Lightning Address (2009-2021)

```bash
# Bitcoin address (hard to remember, changes each time)
bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh

# Lightning invoice (expires, single use, even longer)
lnbc1pvjluezpp5qqqsyqcyq5rqwzqfqqqsyqcyq5rqwzqfqqqsyqcyq5rqwzqfqypqdpl2pkx2ctnv5sxxmmwwd5kgetjypeh2ursdae8g6twvus8g6rfwvs8qun0dfjkxaq8rkx3yf5tcsyz3d73gafnh3cax9rn449d9p5uxz9ezhhypd0elx87sjle52x86fux2ypatgddc6k63n7erqz25le42c4u4ecky03ylcqca784w
```

**Problems:**
- ü§Ø Impossible to memorize
- ‚è±Ô∏è Invoices HAVE to expire at a certain time
- üîÑ New address / invoice needed for each payment
- üì± Required QR codes or copy-paste

### After Lightning Address (2021-Present)

```bash
# Lightning Address (simple, permanent, reusable)
andre@zbd.gg
```

**Solved:**
- ‚úÖ Easy as email ‚Äì memorizable and shareable
- ‚úÖ Works 24/7 ‚Äì receive payments while you sleep
- ‚úÖ One address forever ‚Äì put it in your bio
- ‚úÖ No QR codes needed ‚Äì just type it

## How Lightning Address Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Sends to Address">
    Sender enters `gamer@zbd.gg` in any Lightning wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet Queries Server">
    Wallet looks up `https://zbd.gg/.well-known/lnurlp/gamer`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Server Returns Invoice">
    ZBD creates a fresh Lightning invoice for this payment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Completes">
    Standard Lightning payment flows to recipient
  </Step>
</Steps>

    User->>Wallet: Pay andre@zbd.gg
    Wallet->>ZBD Server: GET /.well-known/lnurlp/andre
    ZBD Server->>Wallet: Payment details + invoice
    Wallet->>ZBD Server: Lightning payment
    ZBD Server->>Recipient: Payment received!
```

    No technical knowledge required. No long strings. No QR codes. Just human-readable addresses.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Permanence">
    **Set It and Forget It**: Unlike invoices that expire or addresses that change, your Lightning Address is permanent. Put it on business cards, social profiles, or billboards.
    
    Receive payments 24/7/365 without generating new invoices.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Interoperability">
    **Universal Standard**: Send from any supporting wallet to any other supporting service. Like email, it just works across providers.
    
    ZBD to Cash App ‚Äì all seamless.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Enhanced Privacy

- No on-chain footprint for address lookups
- Rotating invoices prevent payment correlation
- Optional sender/receiver metadata
- No public address / invoice reuse

### 3. Developer Friendly

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
// Send to Lightning Address
const payment = await zbd.sendLightningAddress({
  lnAddress: 'andre@zbd.gg',
  amount: 1000, // sats
  comment: 'Thanks for creating this!'
});

// Validate Lightning Address
const isValid = await zbd.validateLightningAddress({
  lnAddress: 'user@domain.com'
});
```

```python Python
# Create Lightning Address for user
address = zbd.create_lightning_address(
    username="newuser",
    user_id="usr_123"
)
# Returns: newuser@zbd.gg

# Receive notification on payment
@webhook_handler
def payment_received(data):
    print(f"Received {data.amount} sats")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Advanced Features

### Custom Domains

Run Lightning Address on your own domain:

```nginx
# Nginx config for yourgame.com
location /.well-known/lnurlp/ {
  proxy_pass https://api.zebedee.io/lnurlp/;
  proxy_set_header Host api.zebedee.io;
}
```

Now users can have `player@yourgame.com` addresses!
