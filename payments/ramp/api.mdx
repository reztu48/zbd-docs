Complete reference for all ZBD Ramp API endpoints and webhook events.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.zebedee.io
```

## Authentication

All ZBD endpoints are protected by an API Key. To make requests against these endpoints you must pass a header property called `apikey` with your [ZBD Project API Key](/get-started/api-keys).

```json
apikey: "1PnXYRdcm13gJrHZVzctgCAUIEniVomQR"
```

<Note>
  Get your API keys by [scheduling a call](https://zbd.one/sales) with our sales team.
</Note>


## SSL / HTTPS Access

**ZBD only provides a secure interface over HTTPS with SSL certificate support**. Any requests that attempt to reach the ZBD API in an insecure fashion (plain-text over HTTP requests) will be rejected.

<Note>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely.</Note>
